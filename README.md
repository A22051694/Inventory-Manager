# Inventory-Manager
Inventory Manager with REST API â€” manage product stock and track customer orders using Django backend and HTML/Tailwind frontend with secure login.
Hereâ€™s a clean **field breakdown** (no code) for the `inventory` app, focusing on **two models**: `Product` and `Order`.

## âœ… Optional (Admin/User Role-Based Logic)

* Use `request.user.is_staff` to allow admin-only edits/cancellations.
* Add soft-delete (`is_canceled`) or a delivery flag (`is_delivered`) if needed.

Let me know if you want help mapping these to serializers, forms, or DRF views next.
